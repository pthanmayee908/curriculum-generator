Our project is a Generative AI-based Curriculum Design System that helps teachers and institutions automatically create structured course content. 
The system takes inputs such as subject name, course duration, and skill level, and generates a complete curriculum including modules, topics, learning outcomes, and project ideas.
This reduces the time required for manual curriculum planning and ensures that the course content is organized and relevant to current industry needs. 
The system is especially useful for beginners who want to design academic courses quickly and efficiently.

 Generative AI Curriculum Design System

A Generative AI–powered platform that automates curriculum design by generating structured course frameworks, topic plans, and learning outcomes based on educational requirements.

This system helps educators, institutions, and academic planners efficiently build industry aligned academic programs with intelligent structure and optimization.

 Overview

Designing a complete academic curriculum manually is complex and time-consuming. This project simplifies that process using AI-driven curriculum intelligence.

The system:

. Generates structured course architectures
. Recommends topic breakdowns
. Maps learning outcomes
. Organizes semester-wise academic plans
.Optimizes academic workload and credit distribution

It transforms high-level educational goals into structured, executable academic programs.

 Expected Solutions Delivered

 Course Structure Generation

Automatically creates well-organized course frameworks aligned with degree requirements and specialization goals.

Topic Recommendations

Breaks courses into logical topic sequences and session-level plans to ensure structured knowledge progression.

Curriculum Planning

Designs semester-wise academic roadmaps with balanced credit allocation and workload management.

 Learning Outcome Mapping

Defines measurable learning outcomes for courses and modules to ensure academic clarity and assessment alignment.

 Academic Optimization

Ensures:

* Logical prerequisite flow
* Avoidance of topic redundancy
* Balanced cognitive load
* Time-feasible academic execution

 Objective

To provide an intelligent curriculum planning engine that supports educators in designing scalable, structured, and industry-relevant academic programs efficiently.

 Use Cases

* Universities designing new degree programs
* Institutions aligning curriculum with industry needs
* Educators building structured course modules
* Academic planners optimizing semester distribution

This project demonstrates how Generative AI can enhance academic design by combining structured planning, topic intelligence, and workload optimization into a single integrated system.
