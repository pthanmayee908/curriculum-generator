Our project is a Generative AI-based Curriculum Design System that helps teachers and institutions automatically create structured course content. 
The system takes inputs such as subject name, course duration, and skill level, and generates a complete curriculum including modules, topics, learning outcomes, and project ideas.
This reduces the time required for manual curriculum planning and ensures that the course content is organized and relevant to current industry needs. 
The system is especially useful for beginners who want to design academic courses quickly and efficiently.
Accept user input for course name, level, and duration.
